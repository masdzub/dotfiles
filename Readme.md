# dotfiles
---
This is the dotfiles that I usually use on my device.

This setting is for:
- terminator
- assh
- vim
- ansible

For new installations can run `./install.sh` , for now it can only run on OS ubuntu / debian and derivatives

If u running `./install.sh`, it will install : 
- terminator
- assh
- vim
- ansible
- google chrome
- fish
- and more
